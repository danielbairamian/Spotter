## OpenAI Gym visualisation tool. 


# TODOS:

- UI To display rendering / graphs
- Merge RGB_Array rendering outputs to stack agents
    - Stack renderings like they are
    - Try to separate foreground and background to color code agents
- Find more elegant way of getting rid of Pyglet window
    - Currently, just setting canvas off-screen
    - Might be easy to setup mock server to render without changing pyglet / render func
- Log more useful info
